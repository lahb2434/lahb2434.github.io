To put it plainly and without asking for forgiveness, because I am interested. I've always had this slight curiosity for Software Engineering and Coding. I can remember back to when I was a kid watching my Grandpa Jim typing up his reports on an old IBM computer ( Not sure how old you are or if you remember, but the ones with the monochrome monitor using a green "P1" phosphor screen). Waiting until he left the room to jump up on that chair and type whatever nonsense and eight year old could muster into the prompt. Jam the 5" floppy discs into the drive wonky and power down without saving! Only to be chased from the room moments later.

I think back to highschool, my friends and I were always stalking the computer lab. Playing on the school server sending random images to each other across school or over to the college across the street.  Playing Doom and learning how to change the code to incorporate different effects on the screen ( usually breaking it ).  I even took a C++ class for some college credits, even though the C++ Instructor at the Tech Center across the street from the High School didnt know how to teach C++ so we were generally more confused than educated.

After I graduated and was out on my own I lost sight of my computer Interests for new ones, the Arts! I joined a band and played lots of music. We wrote, played and toured constantly.  Music defined me, music was my soul! Which I would have gladly handed over if I could have played forever.  But like most teenage musicians this was only a dream ( not to give this story a downward sad feel or anything ) and the band, after a few years, split. So the band didn't work out, do they ever? Do most first relationships where person meets person and they fall in love work out? No. No they don't. I was bummed but I wasn't deterred, I was vivacious! So I went to college and studied Audio Recording and Engineering ( more music ðŸ˜‰  ).  

It was amazing but in the end brought to my eyes a view of the Recording Industry I hadn't known before. I'll let you in on a little secret that broke my heart when I learned it, most musicians in a studio can't play their own music. Yeah really, maybe nerves or they can write good music but can't play it that well or who knows. Another little secret is it's all fake, there was a very famous singer ( can't tell you their name, sorry ) who was so terrible at singing, their tracks had to be broken down into 5 second increments and 8 hours of work had to be put into each individual 5 seconds just to make that singer sound like they weren't a shrieking banshee. This wasn't what I imagined, aside from the fact that it's almost impossible to make a living with this degree.

So saddened, I left college for home. Defeated, my dreams smashed. Indebted. More lost than before I left. Everything I knew to be true was a lie, etc.  Also my girlfriend left me while i was in college...

Laugh Out Loud. I wrote it out so you would read it! This is not a sad story. C'est la vie!

Now I had to go out find a job and became a functioning member of society! I had a lot of school debt to pay off after all, luckily for me I found one that paid well and only made you want to cry when made to work 16 hour days in -40Â° winters or 110Â° summers ( not that bad, really ).  I became a Roughneck, yep you read that correctly, a general laborer on a Drilling Rig, *ROUGHNECK* is the title. And I really enjoyed it, it afforded me something else if like doing. Breaking, tearing apart, and reverse engineering things. 
At this job I've occupied for a decade and a half that's what I excel at. Finding issues and figuring out the internal workings of very complicated machinery and keeping it running against a very high demand of output. Trust me when I say a very high demand, it's equivalent to you jumping in your car and flooring the gas pedal 24/7/365 ( we will fill you up on the fly ) the only time you get to take your foot off the gas is when the car breaks. Yeah, it will break about how you think, soon and often. So things break, I figure those things out and fix them. 

Which brings me to how I am. The reason why I am always trying to break into anything to see how it works. I'm curious you see, how does this thing work? How does the world around us work?  What are the machines and gears doing under the hood? What are the internal workings and what makes this tick? I study everything! Anything I can look at objectively and critically, that has empirical evidence, that employs the scientific method, that is fact black and white. 

Now I sum up.

Here's how I view Software Engineering.

> THE FUSION OF ART AND SCIENCE. 
> -somebody somewhere

Every artist needs to have a fundamental understanding of the science of the natural and physical world in order to surpass obstacles and create art. A sculptor must have at very least a basic understanding of the density of material he is trying to mold. And a painter must have an understanding of dimension and light in order to paint in perspective, no matter how abstract.

Every great Scientist must have an imagination and creativity to see beyond the present understanding of their environment in order to develop an idea or technique that will lead to a scientific breakthrough. How many scientists throughout history were considered mad heretics because their imagination led them to believe something very different than the social norm?

I have a mind of both these parts and is the very reason I sought to pursue this as a career after being in the same occupation for so very long.  I appreciate a system that is both black and white, 1's and 0's, controlled, regulated and methodical. A system that speaks to my analytical mind on a personal level through its syntax, either it works or it doesn't, a beautiful system governed by laws.  

At the same time there is a grey area. Where we have the ability to manipulate the language, to write and weave code in a personal style, and build something limited only by our imagination and creativity.  

This is my mind, both logical and lateral.

I want to use it to create something.
